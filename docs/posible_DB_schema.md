Okay, let's explore a table structure where each statistic has its own table, with keys linking related entries. This approach can offer more flexibility and potentially better organization for complex statistical analyses.

Here's a proposed table structure:

**1. Students Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the student.
*   `fname` (TEXT NOT NULL): First name.
*   `lname` (TEXT NOT NULL): Last name.
*   `student_id` (TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL): Unique student identifier (e.g., student ID number).

**2. Sections Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the section.
*   `name` (TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL): Section name (e.g., "COMSC101").
*   `course_code` (TEXT): Course code (e.g COMSC).
*   `term` (TEXT): Term (e.g., "Spring 2025").

**3. Groups Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the group.
*   `name` (TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL): Group name (e.g., "SPRING25").

**4. Section_Stats Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the section statistics.
*   `section_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `Sections.id`.
*   `mean_gpa` (REAL NOT NULL): Average GPA for the section.
*   `count` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Number of valid grades in the section.
*   FOREIGN KEY(`section_id`) REFERENCES `Sections` (`id`)

**5. Group_Stats Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the group statistics.
*   `group_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `Groups.id`.
*   `mean_gpa` (REAL NOT NULL): Average GPA for the group.
*   `stddev` (REAL NOT NULL): Standard deviation of GPAs in the group.
*    FOREIGN KEY(`group_id`) REFERENCES `Groups` (`id`)

**6. Performances Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the performance record.
*   `section_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `Sections.id`.
*   `student_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `Students.id`.
*   `grade` (TEXT NOT NULL): Grade received by the student in the section.
*   `category` (TEXT CHECK(category IN ('good','bad')) NOT NULL): Performance category (e.g., "good", "bad").
    FOREIGN KEY(`section_id`) REFERENCES `Sections` (`id`),
    FOREIGN KEY(`student_id`) REFERENCES `Students` (`id`)

**7. ZScores Table:**

*   `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for the Z-score record.
*   `section_stats_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `Section_Stats.id`.
*   `group_stats_id` (INTEGER NOT NULL): Foreign key referencing `Group_Stats.id`.
*   `z_score` (REAL): Z-score value.
*   `p_value` (REAL): P-value.
*   `significant` (INTEGER): Indicates significance (1 for true, 0 for false).
*   `threshold` (REAL): Significance threshold.
*   `timestamp` (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of the Z-score calculation.
    FOREIGN KEY(`section_stats_id`) REFERENCES `Section_Stats` (`id`),
    FOREIGN KEY(`group_stats_id`) REFERENCES `Group_Stats` (`id`)

**Key Changes and Rationale:**

*   **Separate Stats Tables:** `Section_Stats` and `Group_Stats` tables are created to store the calculated statistics separately.
*   **Foreign Keys for Stats:** The `ZScores` table now has foreign keys referencing both `Section_Stats` and `Group_Stats`, linking the Z-score to the specific statistics used in its calculation.
*   **Course and Term:** Added `course_code` and `term` to the `Sections` table.

**How This Works:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Load student data into the `Students` table.
    *   Load section data into the `Sections` table.
    *   Load group data into the `Groups` table.

2.  **Statistics Calculation:**
    *   Calculate section statistics (mean GPA, count) and store them in the `Section_Stats` table, referencing the corresponding `section_id`.
    *   Calculate group statistics (mean GPA, stddev) and store them in the `Group_Stats` table, referencing the corresponding `group_id`.

3.  **Z-Score Calculation:**
    *   Calculate the Z-score using the section and group statistics.
    *   Store the Z-score, p-value, significance, and threshold in the `ZScores` table, referencing the `section_stats_id` and `group_stats_id` used in the calculation.

4.  **Performance Tracking:**
    *   Store each student's grade and performance category in the `Performances` table, referencing the `section_id` and `student_id`.

**Benefits:**

*   **Normalization:** Reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.
*   **Flexibility:** Easier to add new statistics or modify existing ones without affecting other tables.
*   **Querying:** Simplifies querying for specific statistics or relationships between data.
*   **Historical Analysis:** Easier to track changes in statistics over time.

**Considerations:**

*   **Complexity:** The increased number of tables adds complexity to the database schema.
*   **Joins:** Queries may require more joins to retrieve related data.
*   **Performance:** Performance may be affected by the increased number of tables and joins, especially for large datasets.

This revised structure provides a more normalized and flexible approach to storing and managing your data. Remember to adjust the data types and constraints based on your specific needs and the capabilities of your database system.
